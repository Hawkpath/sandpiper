## Install

To get started, clone the repo.

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/phanabani/sandpiper.git
cd sandpiper
```

[Install Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv).
After installing for the first time, you may have to do some extra steps to
be able to use the `pipenv` command in your shell. Read the note in the
Pipenv installation page for more info.

```shell
python -m pip install --user pipenv
```

Install the dependencies with Pipenv. Sandpiper requires Python 3.9+.

```shell
# If Python 3.9 is your default version:
pipenv sync

# If Python 3.9 is NOT your default version, you should specify the path to
# your Python 3.9 executable
pipenv sync --python "/usr/bin/python3.9"
pipenv sync --python "C:\Miniconda3\envs\python39\python.exe"
```

## Usage

### Set up configuration

Create a json file `sandpiper/config.json` (or copy [sandpiper/config_example.json](sandpiper/config_example.json)).
The only value you need to set is the `bot_token`.

```json
{
    "bot_token": "<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>"
}
```

See [config](#config) for more info.

### Running Sandpiper

#### Basic

In the top level directory, simply run Sandpiper as a Python module with Pipenv.

```shell script
pipenv run python -m sandpiper
```

#### With PM2

[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) is a daemon process
manager. Ensure you've followed the virtual environment setup described above,
then simply run the following command in Sandpiper's root directory:

```shell script
pm2 start
```

This starts the process as a daemon using info from [ecosystem.config.js](ecosystem.config.js).

### Inviting Sandpiper to your Discord server

Sandpiper requires the following permissions to run normally:

- View Channels
- Send Messages
- Embed links

These correspond to the permission integer `19456`.

Sandpiper also requires the [server members privileged intent](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#privileged-intents)
to allow for Discord username/server nickname lookup in the `whois` command.
You can enable it on the bot page of your application (https:\/\/discord.com/developers/applications/<client_id>/bot).

## Config

Sandpiper can be configured with a JSON file at `sandpiper/config.json`.
[sandpiper/config_example.json](sandpiper/config_example.json) contains
default values and can be used as a template. `bot_token` is the only required
field.

See [Config](docs/config.md) for detailed information about setting up the
config file.

## Commands and features

In servers, commands must be prefixed with the configured command prefix
(default=`"!piper "`). When DMing Sandpiper, you do not need to prefix commands.

### Unit conversion

Convert measurements written in regular messages! Just surround a measurement
in curly brackets -- like this: `{5 ft}` -- and Sandpiper will convert it for
you. You can put multiple measurements in a message as long as each is put in
its own brackets.

Many measurements are converted by default without needing to specify an output
unit. Read [Default unit mappings](docs/default_unit_mappings.md) to see all
currently supported default conversions.

You can explicitly specify an output unit like this: `{2 tonnes > lbs}`.
This opens up to you nearly any unit conversion you may need.

Lastly, you can do math in conversions, too! `{2.3 ft + 5 in}`

#### Examples

> guys it's **{30f}** outside today, I'm so cold...

> I've been working out a lot lately and I've already lost **{2 kg}**!!

> I think Jason is like **{6' 2"}** tall

> Lou lives about **{15km}** from me and TJ's staying at a hotel **{1.5km}**
> away, so he and I are gonna meet up and drive over to Lou.

> I weigh about 9.3 stone. For you americans, that's **{9.3 stone > lbs}**

> my two favorite songs are **{5min+27s}** and **{4min+34s}**. that's a total
> time of **{5min+27s + 4min+34s > s}** seconds

> hey sandpiper what's **{30 * 7}**?

### Time conversion

Just like [unit conversion](#unit-conversion), you can also convert times
between timezones! Surround a time in curly brackets `{5:30pm}` and Sandpiper
will convert it to the different timezones of users in your server.

Times can be formatted in 12- or 24-hour time and use colon separators (HH:MM).
12-hour times can optionally include AM or PM to specify what half of the day
you mean. If you don't specify, AM will be assumed.

You can use the keywords `now`, `midnight`, and `noon` instead of a numeric time.
 
You can put multiple times in a message as long as each is put in its own brackets.

You can explicitly specify input and output timezones very similarly to
how units are specified in unit conversion:

Timezone specification | How to write | What it does
---------------------- | ------------ | ------------
Input timezone | `{5:45 PM London}` | Converts 5:45 PM in London time to all timezones of users in your server
Output timezone | `{5:45 PM > Los Angeles}` | Converts 5:45 PM from your timezone to Los Angeles time
Input & output timezone | `{5:45 PM Amsterdam > Helsinki}` | Converts 5:45 PM in Amsterdam time to Helsinki time

To use this feature without having to specify input/output timezones every time,
you and your friends need to set your timezones with the `timezone set` command
(see the [bio commands section](#setting-your-info) for more info).

#### Examples

> do you guys wanna play at **{9pm}**?

> I wish I could, but I'm busy from **{14}** to **{17:45}**

> yeah I've gotta wake up at **{5}** for work tomorrow, so it's an early bedtime
> for me

> ugh I have a 2 hr meeting at **{noon}** tomorrow

> my flight took off at **{7pm new york}** and landed at **{8 AM london}**

> what time is it in dubai right now? **{now > dubai}**

> the game's releasing at **{1 PM > new york}** for americans and
> **{1500 > london}** for europeans

> hey alex, jaakko's getting on at **{8 pm helsinki > amsterdam}**

### Bios

Store some info about yourself to help your friends get to know you more easily!
Unless [specified otherwise in the config file](docs/config.md#botmodulesbios),
most of these commands can only be used in DMs with Sandpiper for your privacy.

#### General commands

Command | Description
------- | -----------
`bio show` | Display all your stored info and their privacy settings.
`bio delete` | Delete all your stored info.

#### Setting your info

Setting a field doesn't automatically make it public. See the [privacy section](#manage-the-privacy-of-your-info)
for more info about managing your privacy.

Command | Description | Example
------- | ----------- | -------
`name set <new_name>` | Set your preferred name (max 64 characters). | `name set Phana`
`pronouns set <new_pronouns>` | Set your pronouns (max 64 characters). | `pronouns set She/Her`
`birthday set <new_birthday>` | Set your birthday in one of the following formats: `1997-08-27`, `8 August 1997`, `Aug 8 1997`, `August 8`, `8 Aug`. You may omit your birth year with the month-name format (age will not be calculated). | `birthday set 1997-08-27`
`timezone set <new_timezone>` | Set your timezone. Don't worry about formatting. Typing the name of the nearest major city should be good enough, but you can also try your state/country if that doesn't work. If you're confused, use this website to find your full timezone name: http://kevalbhatt.github.io/timezone-picker | `timezone set new york`

#### Displaying your info

Command | Description | Example
------- | ----------- | -------
`name show` | Display your preferred name. | `name show`
`pronouns show` | Display your pronouns. | `pronouns show`
`birthday show` | Display your birthday. | `birthday show`

#### Manage the privacy of your info

You can set the privacy for each field in your bio to either `public` or
`private`. Everything is private by default. If you set a field as public,
anyone may be able to see it as long as they are in the same server as you and
Sandpiper.

Command | Description | Example
------- | ----------- | -------
`privacy all <new_privacy>` | Set the privacy of all your info at once. | `privacy all public`
`privacy name <new_privacy>` | Set the privacy of your preferred name. | `privacy name public`
`privacy pronouns <new_privacy>` | Set the privacy of your pronouns. | `privacy pronouns public`
`privacy birthday <new_privacy>` | Set the privacy of your birthday. | `privacy birthday private`
`privacy age <new_privacy>` | Set the privacy of your age. | `privacy age private`
`privacy timezone <new_privacy>` | Set the privacy of your timezone. | `privacy timezone public`

#### Search for users by one of their names

If you're new to a server, you might hear someone's name floating around but not
know who they are. Sandpiper lets you search for users by either their
preferred name (configured with the `name set` command), their Discord username,
or their nickname in a server you are both in.

You can run this command in a server or in Sandpiper DMs.

Command | Description | Example
------- | ----------- | -------
`whois <name>` | Search for a user by one of their names on Discord. | `whois jason`
